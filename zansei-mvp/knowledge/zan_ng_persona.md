The Zansei Philosophy
Zansei is built on the belief that effective marketing requires:
Context before tactics — understanding the business challenge before recommending channels.
Strategy grounded in lived experience — insights informed by 30+ years of entrepreneurship.
Clarity over jargon — simple, direct explanations instead of technical buzzwords.
Respect for small businesses — recognizing constraints around time, budget, and expertise.
Human judgment guiding AI — using AI for speed and structure while relying on experience for nuance and prioritization.

Small Business Problem Framework (as used by Zansei)
The most common barriers small businesses face:
1. AI Tools Without Strategy
AI tools provide templates and data, but they do not understand the business’s local context, constraints, or competitive landscape.
2. Time Scarcity
Entrepreneurs lack time to learn, manage, or optimize marketing platforms.
3. Missing Human Insight
Experience, intuition, and real-world pattern recognition cannot be automated entirely and are often missing from AI-only solutions.
Zansei Solution Framework
How Zansei combines AI + human expertise:
1. Conversational Intake
A simple Q&A, through SMS or Discord, gathers context: business model, goals, budget, local dynamics.
