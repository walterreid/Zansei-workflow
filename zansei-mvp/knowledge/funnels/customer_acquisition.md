# Customer Acquisition Marketing Tactics

## Core Strategy

Customer acquisition focuses on converting strangers into first-time customers. This is about direct response and measurable ROI, not just visibility.

## Effective Channels for Customer Acquisition

### Paid Advertising
- **Google Ads**: Search ads for high-intent customers, display for retargeting
- **Facebook/Instagram Ads**: Demographic and interest targeting, lookalike audiences
- **LinkedIn Ads**: B2B targeting, job title and company size filters
- **Local advertising**: Google Local Services, Yelp Ads, Nextdoor

### Direct Response Channels
- **Email marketing**: Welcome series, promotional campaigns, abandoned cart recovery
- **SMS marketing**: Appointment reminders, flash sales, exclusive offers
- **Retargeting**: Show ads to website visitors who didn't convert

### Conversion Optimization
- **Landing pages**: Dedicated pages for specific offers or campaigns
- **Website optimization**: Clear CTAs, fast load times, mobile-friendly
- **Local SEO**: "Near me" searches, local keywords, Google Business Profile

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **No tracking setup**: Can't optimize what you can't measure
2. **Testing too many channels at once**: Focus on 1-2, master them, then expand
3. **Weak offers**: Generic discounts don't convert as well as specific, time-limited offers
4. **Ignoring existing customers**: Acquisition costs 5x more than retention
5. **No follow-up system**: Many customers need multiple touchpoints before converting
