# Product Launch Marketing Tactics

## Core Strategy

Product launches require building anticipation, creating urgency, and generating initial momentum. Success depends on pre-launch preparation and post-launch momentum.

## Pre-Launch Phase (4-8 Weeks Before)

### Building Anticipation
- **Teaser content**: Behind-the-scenes, sneak peeks, countdown timers
- **Email waitlist**: Collect emails of interested customers
- **Social media buildup**: Daily posts building excitement
- **Influencer partnerships**: Early access for reviews and promotion
- **Press outreach**: Local media, industry publications, blogs

### Preparation
- **Landing page**: Dedicated page with email capture
- **Email sequences**: Pre-launch, launch day, post-launch
- **Social media assets**: Graphics, videos, carousels ready to go
- **Influencer list**: Identify and reach out to relevant creators
- **PR materials**: Press release, media kit, product photos

## Launch Phase (Launch Week)

### Launch Day Strategy
- **Multi-channel announcement**: Email, social media, website, in-store
- **Limited-time offer**: Early bird pricing, launch discount, bonuses
- **Social proof**: Share early reviews, testimonials, user-generated content
- **Live events**: Launch party, live stream, Q&A session
- **Paid promotion**: Boost social posts, run targeted ads

### Channels to Activate
- **Email**: Announce to waitlist and existing customers
- **Social media**: Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, LinkedIn
- **Website**: Homepage banner, dedicated product page
- **Paid ads**: Google, Facebook, Instagram for immediate reach
- **PR**: Press release distribution, media interviews

## Post-Launch Phase (Weeks 2-8)

### Maintaining Momentum
- **User-generated content**: Encourage customers to share
- **Case studies**: Early success stories and testimonials
- **Content marketing**: Blog posts, videos, tutorials
- **Retargeting**: Show ads to website visitors who didn't buy
- **Referral program**: Incentivize early customers to refer others

### Optimization
- **A/B testing**: Test different messaging, offers, creative
- **Conversion optimization**: Improve landing pages, checkout flow
- **Channel analysis**: Double down on what's working
- **Customer feedback**: Iterate based on early user input

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Launching too early**: Product must be ready, support systems in place
2. **No pre-launch buildup**: Surprise launches rarely work for small businesses
3. **Ignoring existing customers**: They're your best launch advocates

5. **Stopping after launch**: Momentum requires continued effort
